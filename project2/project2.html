                <li>The line chart shows CO₂ intensity reduction as a percentage relative to the starting point, rather than absolute values.</li>
                <li>This means that the first year’s value is set to 1.0 for every group or country, and all future values show as proportion of that starting point.</li>
                <li>By normalizing values, this compares relative progress regardless of starting conditions.</li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>While creating these visualizations, the most difficult part was narrowing down the datasets and understanding the specific metrics needed to  best transform them for plotting. My main proposition: “Wealthy nations are leading the global fight against climate change.” In order to create visualizations that support and oppose this stance I used datasets that could support and opposed this stance: <p></p>

        <p>Pro: 'Trade in Low_Carbon_Technology_Products.csv<p></p>
        <p>Con: CO2_Emissions_Intensities_Multipliers.csv, 'Fossil_Fuel_Subsidies.csv'<p></p>
            
            I had the most difficulty in the processing stage, where I had to examine missing values, decide when to fill or drop them, aggregate across different time series, and reshape them into long format for plotting. In addition to understanding each of the chart columns relative to the dataset. 
            
            In the opposing visualizations, for the normalized CO₂ intensity trend, I wanted to compare relative progress between groups, not just who started "cleaner”,  so I normalized both groups to their first-year values. The top fossil fuel subsidies chart was motivated by transparency — showing who’s still spending heavily on fossil fuels relative to their economy. The average CO₂ reduction bar chart was created to fairly summarize effort across groups over time. And the distribution boxplot  offered a more nuanced picture, there’s significant overlap, and some wealthy nations still lag behind in emissions efficiency. My design intention across all of these charts was to mainly demonstrate earnest techniques or fact-based, honest, and visually interpretable. 
            
            In the Supporting visualization , the “Top Climate Finance Comparison (Horizontal Bar Chart)” 
            visually demonstrates and compares  wealthy nations' absolute financial commitment to climate action. Aims to showcase wealthy nations' dominance in climate finance contributions. The investment growth line chart showed progression and momentum in climate action. By normalizing the data to a base year, this visualization emphasizes relative growth rather than absolute values, which highlights wealthy nations' sustained investment over time. Shaded areas beneath the lines create a visual of cumulative contribution, highlighting wealthy nations' consistent leadership. The pie chart visualization shows market dominance and global impact, representing wealthy nations' share of global low carbon technology exports. This chart creates an immediate impression of their outsized influence in the green technology market. The Low Carbon Tech Exports as Percentage of GDP (Bar Chart) comparing low carbon tech exports as a percentage of GDP shows proportional relative to economic capacity. Addresses a potential counterargument that wealthy nations' contributions only appear larger because of their larger economies which shows wealthy nations commit a higher percentage of their GDP to climate technology. . 
            
            After creating these visualizations, l learned that persuasive and deceptive visualization is often subtle and contextual. And I believe that as data scientists we have a responsibility to interpret and create visualizations that balance advocacy with honesty. Techniques like color emphasis, selective timeframes, and careful metric selection can dramatically influence perception without falsifying data. The same dataset can tell opposite stories depending on which metrics are highlighted and how they're presented. When working with the pro-side visualization, I found that techniques like using saturated colors for wealthy nations, exploding pie chart segments, and carefully worded titles could enhance the narrative without crossing into outright deception.. Effective data visualization requires deep engagement with the underlying questions. This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how design choices influence interpretation and how to balance advocacy with transparency.
